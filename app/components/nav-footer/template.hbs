			<p>This site was created with Ember, using HTMLBars, and SCSS.</p>
			<p>The CSS was constructed with SCSS (a css pre-processor) and is using a blend of OOCSS, SMACSS, and ITCSS
				principles, I call it MYCSS!</p>
			<p>The HTML is using HTML5 standards and SHOULD be 508 compliant, however everyone seems to have their own
				definition of 508 compliancy standards...</p>
			<p>Tested in IE10+, Edge, Firefox, &amp; Chrome.</p>

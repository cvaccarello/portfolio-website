// Using a cross between SMACSS, ITCSS, and OOCSS principles, with a bit of customization to better match this project
// I call this process "MYCSS", b/c ultimately it's whatever works best for you and your system

// Libs:		Outside libraries which generally are customized a bit from their original version
@import 'libs/index';

// Settings:	Global variables, config switches
@import 'mycss/1-settings/index';

// Tools:		Default mixins, functions, and utility classes
@import 'mycss/2-tools/index';

// NOTE:  		Skipped ITCSS "Generic" b/c I don't really have use for "wide-reaching styles" other than blanket box-sizing, which I've just put in base

// Base:		Unclassed HTML elements
@import 'mycss/3-base/index';

// Objects:		Cosmetic-free Patterns, Layouts, Wrappers, Containers, etc.  These are like SMACSS Layout Rules.
@import 'mycss/4-objects/index';

// Modules:		Chunks of small reusable UI classes (not to be confused with ember components, which are imported below as "pods")
@import 'mycss/5-modules/index';

// NOTE:  		Skipped ITCSS "Trumps" as I don't need those for this project (nothing needs overrided with "!important")

// Pods:		Styles unique to Ember Components/Pods
@import "pods";

// Pages:		Page specific styles, not reusable
@import 'pages/index';

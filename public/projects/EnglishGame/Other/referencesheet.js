Changing the questions/answers
- No capital letters in the answers
- If you want to use quotes inside the current quotes, use a single quote
  Example:
    Incorrect: "Bodies beating at its beautiful walls"
    Correct: 'Bodies beating at its beautiful walls'
- Or you can use double quotes if the outside double quotes are turned into single quotes
  Double Quotes look like this "Hello"
  Single Quotes look like this 'Hello'
- Try to end each line with the semi colon ;
- Also do not add line breaks.  This means do not press the Enter key to create space between lines in a question

Adding/Deleting questions
- If you add/delete questions make sure to add/delete them from either the storequestions area at the bottom of this page, and the storeanswers one.
- In the storequestions area at the bottom makes sure you keep the "End Game" at the end of the line.
- Only change the A1, A2, A3... in the center of the parenthesis (A1, A2, A3...)
- If you delete a questions you'll have to change the numbers around so you don't have a space between numbers (1, 2, 4, 5)
- I SUGGEST NOT DELETING A QUESTION, only changing them, it's less confusing.
- Make sure the numbers are consistent.  (1, 2, 3, 4, 5) not (1, 2, 4, 5) I noticed that happened a few times.

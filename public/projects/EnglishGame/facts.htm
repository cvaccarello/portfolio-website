		<b>Instructions</b>
                <ul>
                  <li>A characters speed is how far they can move per roll of the die.  For example Speed: +2 means that you will move +2 spaces per roll.  If you rolled a 4 then you will move 4+2= 6 spaces.  If you roll a 3 you will move 5 spaces.
		  <li>Money: 25$ means you will recieve 25 dollars/points per space.  If you move 10 spaces you'll recieve 250 dollars (10x25).
		  <li>Now luck is simply your chances at getting a good card when you land on "draw a card."  Luck has nothing to do with rolling the die.  If you choose Grendel, your luck will be quite poor.  You'll find that quite often you recieve cards that are negative in some way.
		  <li>Finally, each character is different.  Each one comes with his/her own story.  Example: One of Grendels' cards will say "Beowulf has taken your arm" and you will lose money or go back a number of spaces.
                </ul>
		<b>Other Information</b>
                <ul>
                  <li>This Version of the game was a couple thousands of lines of code.
                  <li>The initial first version took me several hours to make, but I have been improving it over time for a year.
                  <li>Teachers are jealous of my game, so tell them about it and make them all jealous of Mrs.Lestitians class! lol (yes I know, 'lol' isn't proper english, nor will most teachers understand what it means :p haha)
                  <li>If I ever get my own server, which is quite possible, I'll re-upload the PHP version with highscores, comment box, store, and saved points, possibly saved game play as well.  I originally had this game hosted on another site, but it became too much work to keep my server space.
		  <li>Almost all of the graphics were made by me.  The sword and shield weren't mine, and 6 of the player pieces were only edited by me.  As for the 7th game piece, I made almost all of it myself.

                  Big thanks to Mrs.Lestitian for providing me the opportunity to create this awsome game ^_^ and thanks to all my friends who help test my game as I developed it.
                  <br>
                  By the way, If you restart the game, and instead of clicking a piece to start, click my name in the bottom left corner ;)
